The aspect of our design is the registration process, verifying a voter is essential in
establishing security within the system. Making sure that someone’s identity isn’t being misused
for fraudulent purposes is important, especially when voting is considered, where every vote
matters.

To allow a user to register as a voter, they will be required to provide three important details, which will be enough to auntheticate their bonafidity. The three unnegotiable details required will be:
```
* AADHAR Card Number
* Residential/Postal Address
* Email ID and a Pin for future correspondence
```

Once someone has registered an automated government miner analyses the transaction and if
they haven’t been awarded or denied a vote, the miner will make the decision as to whether to
verify the user or not. Once the user has been granted voting, the request with the details will be sent to the Election Commission of India and voter ID card will be delivered to the user's address as in normal stipulated time.
