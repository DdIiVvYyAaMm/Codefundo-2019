Democratic voting is a crucial and serious event in any country. The most common way in which
a country votes is through a paper based system, but is it not time to bring voting into the 21st
century of modern technology? Digital voting is the use of electronic devices, such as voting
machines or an internet browser, to cast votes. These are sometimes referred to as e-voting when
voting using a machine in a polling station, and i-voting when using a web browser.
Security of digital voting is always the biggest concern when considering to implement a digital
voting system. With such monumental decisions at stake, there can be no doubt about the
system’s ability to secure data and defend against potential attacks. One way the security issues
can be potentially solved is through the technology of blockchains.
Blockchain technology originates from the underlying architectural design of the cryptocurrency
bitcoin. It is a form of distributed database where records take the form of transactions, a block is
a collection of these transactions. With the use of blockchains a secure and robust system for digital voting can be devised. This project attempts to bring the voter ID card generation system totally online as well as transparent to make it easy for the voter as well as transparent so as to free from the allegations of bogus voters.

The aspect of our design is the registration process, verifying a voter is essential in
establishing security within the system. Making sure that someone’s identity isn’t being misused
for fraudulent purposes is important, especially when voting is considered, where every vote
matters.

To allow a user to register as a voter, they will be required to provide three important details, which will be enough to auntheticate their bonafidity. The three unnegotiable details required will be:
```
* AADHAR Card Number
* Residential/Postal Address
* Email ID and a Pin for future correspondence
```

Once someone has registered an automated government miner analyses the transaction and if
they haven’t been awarded or denied a vote, the miner will make the decision as to whether to
verify the user or not. Once the user has been granted voting, the request with the details will be sent to the Election Commission of India and voter ID card will be delivered to the user's address as in normal stipulated time.
