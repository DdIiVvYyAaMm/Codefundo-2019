Designing a model for election and referendum using Azure Blockchain making the procedure reliable, transparent and covert.

The salient features of the model that we propose are:
``` 
A covert 1 to Counting election model.

A reliable counting methodology.

A reliable `online voter verification` and `voting enabling` ledger record system.
```
